# SDL Examples Notes

This text file is a set of notes for easy future reference.

## Overview

* **Project name**: sdl-examples
* **Language**: C
* **Prerequisites for build system**: cmake (version 3.17 or higher)

## Repository Structure

* `build` directory: generated by cmake
* `CMakeLists.txt`: configures the build process using cmake
* `dda.c`: contains code related to the DDA line drawing algorithm
* `display.c`: example for display backend (X11 or Wayland)
* `docs/` directory: contains documentation for each example program
  - `building.md`
  - `dda.md`
  - `displays.md`
  - `drivers.md`
  - `precision.md`
  - `simple.md`
* `doom.c`: work in progress example for the Doom game
* `drivers.c`: iterates over all available device drivers
* `line.c`: manually draws a line
* `precision.h`: custom 32-bit and 16-bit precision (IEEE-754)
* `primitives.h`: common data structures for game development
* `README.md`: introductory text file explaining the repo

## Working Environment

* **Operating System**: Arch Linux x86_64
* **Desktop Environment**: GNOME

## Prerequisites for SDL-Examples

* SDL2 installed and added to PATH
* C/C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MinGW)
* CMake or equivalent tool
* Text editor or IDE of choice

## Tutorial Focus

The tutorial will focus on creating a pseudo-3D graphics rendering engine from scratch using plain C programming language, with the exception of using SDL2 for graphical context and event handling.
