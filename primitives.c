 * This file contains structures and functions to define and manipulate
 * geometric primitives such as points, line segments, polygons, and screen-space
 * representations of these primitives for a software rendering engine inspired by DOOM.
 *
 * The structures defined in this file represent the level information about walls:
 * their position, size, shape, height, and distance from camera to enable 3D transformation
 * and projection onto the screen space.
