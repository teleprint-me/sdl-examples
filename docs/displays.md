# SDL on Linux - Detecting Display Backend (X11 vs. Wayland)
## Introduction

The Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library is a powerful tool for developers creating cross-platform multimedia applications. It provides a robust framework for handling graphics, sound, and input across various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. SDL is widely used in game development, emulation, and other multimedia applications. This document will focus on detecting the display backend (X11 or Wayland) on Linux systems using SDL.

## Building SDL Projects with CMake

Building SDL projects on multiple platforms can be streamlined using CMake, a cross-platform build system generator. Below is an example `CMakeLists.txt` file that can be used to set up a basic SDL project. This configuration supports automated building processes, making it easier to manage dependencies and platform-specific settings.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(SDL_Display_Backend_Detection)

# Find SDL2
find_package(SDL2 REQUIRED)
include_directories(${SDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS})

# Add SDL2 library for linking
add_link_options(-lSDL2)

# Create executable
add_executable(detect_backend main.c)

# Link SDL2 library
target_link_libraries(detect_backend ${SDL2_LIBRARIES})
```

## Detecting Display Backend (X11 vs. Wayland) in Linux Systems

Linux systems typically use either the X11 or Wayland display server protocols. Detecting which backend is in use can be crucial for optimizing performance and ensuring compatibility in multimedia applications. This can be done by checking specific environment variables.

- `XDG_SESSION_TYPE`: Indicates the session type (e.g., "x11" or "wayland").
- `X11_DISPLAY`: Set when an X11 display is being used.
- `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`: Set when a Wayland display is being used.

**Example Program Using SDL**

The following example program demonstrates how to use SDL to determine the display backend in use. The program checks the relevant environment variables and prints whether the backend is X11 or Wayland.

```c
/*
 * Example program using Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) to determine which
 * display backend (X11 or Wayland) is being used on Linux systems.
 */

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(void) {
    const char* wayland_session_type = getenv("XDG_SESSION_TYPE");
    const char* x11_display          = getenv("X11_DISPLAY");
    const char* wayland_display      = getenv("WAYLAND_DISPLAY");

    /*
     * If WAYLAND_DISPLAY is set, it means Wayland is being used
     */
    if (wayland_display != NULL && strcmp(wayland_session_type, "wayland") == 0) {
        printf("Using display backend: Wayland\n");

    } else if ((x11_display != NULL && strcmp(wayland_session_type, "x11") == 0)) {
        /*
         * Otherwise, we fall back to checking for X11
         */
        printf("Using display backend: X11\n");

    } else {
        fprintf(stderr, "Could not detect display backend.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

**Implementation Details**

The implementation involves checking the values of environment variables related to the display server. The program uses the `getenv` function to retrieve the values of `XDG_SESSION_TYPE`, `X11_DISPLAY`, and `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`.

- If `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` is set and `XDG_SESSION_TYPE` is "wayland", the program prints "Using display backend: Wayland".
- If `X11_DISPLAY` is set and `XDG_SESSION_TYPE` is "x11", the program prints "Using display backend: X11".
- If neither condition is met, the program prints an error message indicating that it could not detect the display backend.

**Conclusion**

In this document, we've explored how to detect the display backend (X11 or Wayland) on Linux systems using SDL. We provided an example `CMakeLists.txt` file for building SDL projects and a sample program that checks environment variables to determine the display backend. This knowledge is crucial for developers looking to optimize their applications for different display servers on Linux.
