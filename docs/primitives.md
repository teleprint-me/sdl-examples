1. Points (vertices) - Represents a single point in 2D or 3D space, usually defined by X, Y, and Z coordinates.
2. Line segments - Connects two points with straight line.
3. Polygons - A flat shape formed by connecting three or more vertices with edges.
4. Model Space - An abstract coordinate system used to describe the positions, orientations, and dimensions of geometric objects before applying transformations.
5. World Space - Represents the game level where all 3D objects exist.
6. Screen Space - Everything that is transformed into a shape displayed on your screen. A four-sided polygon used to represent shapes in the screen space.
