# The Digital Differential Analyzer Algorithm

The [Digital Differential Analyzer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_differential_analyser) is used for line drawing in computer graphics, providing a simple and efficient method to render lines. Understanding the underlying mathematics behind algorithms like DDA is crucial for developing creative solutions to complex problems in computer graphics and video game development.

## Introduction

The DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) algorithm is an efficient way to draw a straight line between two points in a 2D space. The core idea is to calculate the intermediate points along the line by incrementally adding a small, fixed-step size to the starting point's coordinates.

## Mathematical Foundations

The DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) algorithm can be understood through several mathematical concepts:

- **Midpoint Calculation**: Determines the midpoint between two endpoints of a line segment.
- **Iterative Increments**: Moves to the next point by adding fractional increments to each coordinate.
- **Slope and Rate of Change**: Utilizes the slope and rate of change of a line.
- **Average Rate of Change**: Applies the average rate of change.
- **Gradient Steps**: Incrementally determines the next point based on the number of steps with respect to a gradient.

This document aims to provide an accessible understanding of the DDA algorithm while connecting it to relevant mathematical concepts from various resources, such as Blitzer's *Introductory Algebra* and Wiley's *Applied Calculus*.

## Algorithm Steps

### 1. Input the coordinates of the start $(x_1, y_1)$ and end $(x_2, y_2)$ points

The algorithm begins by taking the coordinates of the two endpoints of the line segment. Let’s denote them as $(x_1, y_1)$ for the starting point and $(x_2, y_2)$ for the ending point.

#### Defining Our Parameters

- **Starting Point**: Define the starting point as $p_{start} = (x_1, y_1) = (0, 0)$.
- **Ending Point**: Define the ending point as $p_{end} = (x_2, y_2) = (4, 5)$.

#### Data Structure for Points

We define a data structure representing a point to manage the coordinates of points:

```c
typedef struct Point { // Coordinates of a point
    float x; // horizontal axis
    float y; // vertical axis
} point_t;
```

#### Instantiating Points

We then create instances of this structure for the starting and ending points:

```c
// Example points for illustration
point_t p_start = {0, 0};  // x_1, y_1
point_t p_end   = {4, 5};  // x_2, y_2
```

### 2. Calculate the differences between the coordinates

We define the **Slope of a Line** as follows:

$$\text{slope} = \frac{Δy}{Δx} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

The changes in $x$ and $y$ represent the horizontal and vertical distances between the start and end points.

- **Change in $y$ ($\Delta y$)** is defined as $\Delta y = y_2 - y_1$
- **Change in $x$ ($\Delta x$)** is defined as $\Delta x = x_2 - x_1$

Given $(x_1, y_1) = (0, 0)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (4, 5)$, we have:

$$\Delta y = y_2 - y_1 = 5 - 0 = 5$$
$$\Delta x = x_2 - x_1 = 4 - 0 = 4$$

We can reason this as having a two-dimensional (2D) plane where we move **right** by 4 units and **upward** by 5 units. The **Slope of the Line (m)** between these points is $\frac{Δy}{Δx} = \frac{5}{4}$ (or $1.25$).

We can define the changes in the positions of these points in C as follows:

```c
int delta_y = p_end.y - p_start.y;
int delta_x = p_end.x - p_start.x;
```

### 3. Determine the number of steps required to draw the line

The number of steps required to draw the line is determined by the maximum of the absolute values of $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$. This ensures that we take enough steps to cover the entire line.

$$\text{steps} = \max(|\Delta x|, |\Delta y|)$$

Given $\Delta x = 4$ and $\Delta y = 5$, we calculate the steps as follows:

$$\text{steps} = \max(|4|, |5|) = 5$$

This calculation is straightforward with whole integers but can become more complex with floating-point values, which is beyond the scope of this article.

We can calculate this in C as follows:

```c
int steps = abs(delta_x) > abs(delta_y) ? abs(delta_x) : abs(delta_y);
```
